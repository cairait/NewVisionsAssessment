# NewVisionsAssessment
## by Caira Telesford


Thank you so much for the opportunity to complete this assessment. It really gave me a great idea of what type of projects I would be working on if I am fortunate enough to be selected for the residency!

I learned a lot and I did a lot of Googling and I am very happy with my final result.


To access the information requested:
- Please fork the code onto your local computer
- Use the HTML file to open the webpage onto your local browser (preferably Google Chrome)
- Right click and select 'inspect'
- You should now see Elements, Console, Sources, Network, Performance, Memory, Application, and Lighthouse at the heading of the developer tools
- In the Google Chrome Console, you should see the data requested (you may have to click on the carrots to reveal a dropdown with information)

Thank you so much for your consideration!
