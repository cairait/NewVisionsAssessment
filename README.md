# NewVisionsAssessment
## by Caira Telesford


Thank you so much for the opportunity to complete this assessment. It really gave me a great idea of what type of projects I would be working on if I am fortunate enough to be selected for the residency!

I learned a lot and I did a lot of Googling and I am very happy with my final result.


To access the information requested:

Thank you so much for your consideration!
